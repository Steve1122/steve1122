	Washington Consensus: A Theoretical Anchorage to Development
	Washington consensus 
<br>

It involved a heavy attachment to universalist neo-liberal ideology, with absolute commitment to the free market and presumption of the state as a source of both inefficiencies and corrupt, not least through rent seeking (Krueger 1974).  It comprised four elements.  First is the hegemony of modern neo classical theory within political economy.  In general, the neoclassical theory assumes that the market is efficient and the state is inefficient.  It naturally follows assumption that themarked rather than the state should address such economic problems of development as industrial growth, international competitiveness and employment creation.  Unquestioned belief in the neo classical theory also lead to the assumption that capital mobility and relentless advance of “globalization” is good for the world economy and all individual economies.  Although these policies offer possibility of rapid growth by attracting foreign capital.  Finally, given the priority attached to monetary policies over fiscal policies, interest rates became the most important economic tool.  It was believed that “correct” interest rates could deliever balance of payments equilibrium, low inflation, sustainable levels of consumption and investment, improved allocation of resources and, therefore, high long-run growth rates.
Second, the pre-WC, the main reason why poor countries remain poor is their lack of capital (machines, infrastructure and money), and development is a process of systemic transformation through modernization and industrialization; driven by domestic consumption and domestically-financed, capital accumulation.  In contrast, in view of the WC, countries are poor because of misconceived state intervention, corruption, inefficiency and misguided economic incentives.  According to WC, development is the inevitable outcome of a set of “appropriate” incentives and neoclassical intervention in prices, labour market “flexibility” and trade, financial and capita account liberalization.  There is little specification of what the end-state would look like but, presumably, all countries would eventually approach an ideal version of the United States.
Third, the WC emphasis on the virtues of the market was supported by Hayek.  Despite the libertarian streak associated with these theories even the most ardent supporter of freedom of the individual in general, and through the market in particular agrees that there freedoms can be guaranteed only through state provision of, and coercion for, a core set of functions and institutions.  These range from fiscal and monetary policies to law and order and property rights, and includes military intervention to secure the “market economy” when this become necessary.  Not surprisingly, then WC policies are often associated with authoritarianism, while the WC declarations of support for political democracy are hebdged and conditional in practice (Chile serve as a classic illustration Barber,1995).  While the WC claimed to be leaving as much as possible to the market, in practice it encouraged state intervention on a discretionary basis and directed to systematic promotion of a globalized and heavily-financialized capitalism.
